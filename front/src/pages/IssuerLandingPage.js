<h1>Welcome to the Issuer of LEARCredentials</h1>
<p>This site is intended for Legal Representatives of companies who want to issue one or more LEARCredentials to one or more employees of the company.</p>
<p>A LEARCredential is a type of Verifiable Credential which enables an employee, nominated by a legal representative, to act on behalf of an organisation with restricted powers with respect to third-parties.
    <ol>
        <li>The issuer of the LEARCredential <b>must be a legal representative</b> of the company. The legal representative will sign the LEARCredential with an eIDAS digital certificate, which can be either a personal one or a certificate of representation.</li>
        <li>The receiver of the LEARCredential (both the subject and holder of the credential) <b>can be any employee (or contractor)</b> of the company. The legal representative will delegate a restricted set of powers to that person. Those restricted powers are included inside the credential and can be verified by any Relying party to whom the holder presents the LEARCredential.</li>
    </ol>
